## Introduction
Design patterns are essential tools for software developers. They help improve code readability, reusability, and maintainability. This repository serves as a reference for understanding and implementing design patterns in your projects.

## Categories of Design Patterns

### Creational Patterns
Creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. Examples include:
- Singleton
- Factory Method
- Builder

### Structural Patterns
Structural patterns focus on the composition of classes and objects. Examples include:
- Adapter
- Facade

### Behavioral Patterns
Behavioral patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. Examples include:
- Observer
- Strategy

## How to Use This Repository
Each design pattern is implemented in a separate folder with:
- A brief explanation of the pattern.
- Code examples in a specific programming language.
- Use cases and benefits of the pattern.

Feel free to explore the folders and learn at your own pace.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have examples or improvements for any design pattern, please submit a pull request. Make sure to follow the contribution guidelines.

Happy coding!
