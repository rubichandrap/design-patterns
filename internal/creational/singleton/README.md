# Singleton Pattern

## What is it?
Singleton ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

## Analogy
Think of it like a **printer spooler** â€” there's only one spooler that manages all print jobs in a system.

## When to use?
- When exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system (e.g., Logger, Configuration Manager).
