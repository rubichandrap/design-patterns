# Factory Pattern

## What is it?
Factory Pattern defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.

## Analogy
Like ordering a pizza from a menu â€” you don't know how it's made internally, but you get the result you requested.

## When to use?
- When the creation process is complex or should be hidden from the user.
