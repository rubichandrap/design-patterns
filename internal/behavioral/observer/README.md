# Observer Pattern

## What is it?
Observer defines a one-to-many dependency so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified.

## Analogy
Like subscribing to a newsletter — whenever there's new content, all subscribers get notified.

## When to use?
- When a change to one object requires changing others, and you don’t know how many dependents there are.
